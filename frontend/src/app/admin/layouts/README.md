# Layouts folder for Admin

The layout is responsible for structuring the look of the application. It gathers the required components together where neccessary.

## Types of layout

  For now there are currently two layouts which will be the structure for all (i.e. Admin, Private and Public)

  1. Full: This component structures the view to have a sidebar, navigation bar and chat bar where necessary. main view will sit in the middle. Examples of where this will be used is home page (feeds), profile page etc.

  2. Content: This contains all the component needed to be presented (i.e. just the main view). no side bar, navigation or chat. Example where this will be used is the sign in page, sign up page etc.
