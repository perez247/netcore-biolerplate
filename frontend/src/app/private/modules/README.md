# Modules folder for Private

A module is a mechanism to group components, directives, pipes and services that are related, in such a way that can be combined with other modules to create an application. stolen from [here](https://angular-2-training-book.rangle.io/modules/introduction) :).

All the modules needed for the Private alone should be stored here.
